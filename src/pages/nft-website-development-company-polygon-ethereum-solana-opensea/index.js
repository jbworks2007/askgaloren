              <h1 className="text-center">What is an NFT Smart Contract?</h1>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
              <p>
                NFTs are basically crypto tokens that are managed on blockchain
                and smart contracts are central to NFT functioning. They are
                software codes that allow the network to store the indicated
                information in an immutable and transparent manner in an NFT
                transaction. These codes control NFTs.

              <p className="lead">
                Smart contracts not only made the availability of the NFT
                possible but also brought many changes in the Crypto and
                blockchain world. It emerged as a need when the centralised
                system that existed, made users compromise on various features

                <strong>Efficiency</strong>
              </h5>
              <p>
                Smart contracts mitigate the major issues like the
                low-efficiency rate of the manual and individual module
                component working models, the high cost of intermediary
                validations in financial structures, etc.
              </p>
              <h5>
                <strong>Authenticity</strong>
              </h5>
              <p>
                Smart contracts rule out the possibility of lack of authenticity
                of assets, ownership claims, tampering and other threats.
              </p>
              <h5>
                <strong>Safe and transparent</strong>
              </h5>
              <p>
                Smart contracts ensure the safety of data as the transaction is
                recorded in a decentralized registry that generates records of
                transactions that cannot be tampered with or deleted.
