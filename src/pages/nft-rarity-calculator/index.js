            the initial purchase price of the NFT, the transaction fees
            associated with buying and selling the NFT, and the current market
            value of the NFT. Users can enter these variables into the
            calculator, which will provide them with an estimate of the
            potential profits they can make if they sell the NFT at a certain
            price point.

            NFT rarity refers to the level of uniqueness and scarcity of a specific non-fungible token (NFT). The rarity of an NFT is determined by various factors such as its attributes, characteristics, and historical sales data. Typically, an NFT that has unique features, is part of a limited edition collection, or has a high level of demand is considered to be more rare and valuable. Rarity plays a significant role in determining the value of an NFT and can impact its market price. NFT rarity is a crucial aspect of the NFT ecosystem, as it helps collectors, investors, and creators identify the most valuable assets and make informed decisions about buying, selling, or holding their NFTs.
