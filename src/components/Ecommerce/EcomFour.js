              <p className="lead">
                E-commerce refers to the buying and selling of goods across an electronic medium, such as the internet. When someone says e-commerce these days, they’re usually referring to the purchasing and selling of goods through the internet. E-commerce, on the other hand, refers to any transaction that is performed by electronic means.
              </p>
              <p className="lead">
                Business-to-business (websites like Shopify), business-to-consumer (websites like Amazon), and consumer-to-consumer (websites such as ebay) are the three primary categories of e-commerce .
              </p>
              <p className="lead">
                Here are some examples of e-commerce…

              <h5>Business-to-Business (b2b ecommerce development) :-</h5>
              <p className="lead">
                The concept of trading online from one enterprise to another, or wholesaling, is described as business-to-business, or b2b.
              </p>
              <h5>Business-to-Consumer (b2c ecommerce development) :-</h5>
              <p className="lead">
                Since it’s so simple for companies to target specific consumers online, most of the e-commerce nowadays is b2c. Companies can now showcase their products on the internet, allowing customers to buy them from the comfort of their own homes, saving them time.

                Do you remember the shirt you bought? Because you didn’t have time to replace it with the shopkeeper, where did it end up? You never ever wore it , you tucked it away at the back of your closet.
              </p>
              <h5>Why not put it up for sale? </h5>
              <p className="lead">
                Customers can submit pictures of the product to sites like eBay and you can send it to those who might be interested in buying it.
              </p>
              <h5>It’s gone, gone, gone!</h5>
              <p className="lead">
                Selling on the internet is straightforward and quick. A lot of customers avoid purchasing products if they know they will have to travel to the store to do so.

                Fashion stores are only one example of how instantly merchandise can be sold online. Customers are advised to go online if they can’t find their size in a particular store.
